Boston Scrape
=============

This script was used to generate lists of entrants in the Boston Marathon for a
given state. Unfortunately the Boston Marathon [entrants
form](http://www.baa.org/entrants.html) would not return more than 50 results at
one time, so we had to iterate through a series of filters returning less than
50 results at a time that ultimately summed up to the entire data set.

Don't abuse this

Get the data you need and stop.
