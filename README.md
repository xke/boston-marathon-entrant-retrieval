This script was used to generate lists of entrants in the Boston Marathon based
on city/state. Unfortunately the Boston Marathon [entrants
form](http://www.baa.org/entrants.html) would not return more than 50 results at
one time, so by iterating through a series of filters returning less than 50
results at a time that ultimately summed up to the entire data set, I was able
to retrieve the information fairly quickly.
